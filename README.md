# PRODIGY_WD_03
This code sets up a Tic Tac Toe game with two modes: Human vs Human and Human vs Computer. It includes a header, game mode selection images, and a 3x3 grid for the game board. The grid cells are hidden initially and will be displayed when a mode is selected. The game logic and interactions are managed by an external JavaScript file, "x-o-game.js".
